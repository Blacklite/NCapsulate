NCapsulate
==========

NuGet and MSBuild wrappers around various Node based tools.


Why?
----
NCapsulate's goal is to surround useful tools like NodeJS, NPM, Bower, Gulp
and more while not requiring developers to install the tools or understand
how to use their console, and console commands.

The goal is to make it portable and compatible with NuGet Package Restore.
With those goals in mind, it allows larger .NET development teams to adopt
different Front End Tools for building applicaitons, without affecting the
developer that typcially works behind the scenes, and doesn't care about
the front end world.  While giving the Front End Developers the ability to
adopt modern tools, and processes to create exceptional User Experiences.
